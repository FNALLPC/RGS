# RGS
## Introduction
The Random Grid Search (RGS) algorithm is a simple, but surprisingly effective, way to find rectangular cuts. Developed by Harrison Prosper, Chip Stewart, Pushpa Bhat and generalized by Sezen Sekmen to include *two-sided* and *staircase* cuts. A two-sided cut is a cut of the for (x1 < x < x2), while a staircase cut is the OR of two or more one-sided cuts.

## Installation
This package depends on the package [Root](https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root) from CERN. To install Root follow the instructions at the [Root](https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root) website. Then do
```
git clone https://github.com/hbprosper/RGS.git
cd RGS
make
source setup.sh
```
The setup need be done only once per terminal session. (Note: the bash setup can be "sourced" from any directory, but currently the non-bash setup must be sourced from the RGS directory.)

## Examples
There are two examples in the *examples* directory of RGS
### Higgs
This example illustrates three RGS optimizations, HO1, HO2, and HO3, designed isolate Higgs vector boson fusion events. Each optimization can be run by executing the _train.py_ and _analysis.py_ programs. For example,
HO1 can be run as follows
```
cd examples/Higgs/HO1
./train.py
```
which will run RGS and store the results in a file called *HO1.root*. To analyze the results of RGS do
```
./analysis.py
```
which will read the results from *HO1.root*. 

### SUSY
This example illustrates three optimizations, SO1, SO2, and SO3 that use staircase cuts to improve the search for SUSY events. Switch to the *SUSY* directory and proceed as in the Higgs example.
