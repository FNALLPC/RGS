Higgs boson example
-------------------

First define environment variables by "sourcing" the setup scripts from the
RGS directory:

    source setup.sh   (for a bash shell)

Description
-----------
In this example, we use RGS optimization to find cuts that produce a sample of 
events in the 4-lepton final states enriched in Higgs vector boson fusion (VBF)
events relative to di-Z boson (ZZ) events and Higgs boson events produced
through gluon gluon fusion (ggF).Three optimizations are considered, labeled
HO1, HO2, and HO3. RGS optimization consists of two steps. In the first,
implemented by executing the command

   ./train.py

the signal and background counts associated with each cut is determined and the
results stored in a ROOT file. In the second, the results stored in this ROOT
file are analyzed through the command

   ./analysis.py

which computes the Z value of each cut and finds the best cut, that is, the one
with the hightest Z value.

HO1
---
One-sided cuts

   Z1mass <
   Z2mass <

on the Z-boson masses, Z1mass and Z2mass, and specified in the file HO1.cuts,
are used to discriminate between Higgs boson events (ggF+VBF) and ZZ events.
There is no explicit restriction on the 4-lepton mass (mass4l). The results of
the second step are written to the file r_HO1.txt, the cuts are represented
graphically in h_HO1.pdf, and a receiver operating curev (ROC) in shown in the
file h_HO1_ROC.pdf.

HO2
---
This is like HO1, except that we use two-sided cuts, specified as follows 

   Z1mass <>
   Z2mass <>

in the file HO2.cuts and we restrict events to the signal region defined by
100 < mass4l < 150 GeV. Note that the cuts form a closed rectangle in the
(Z1mass, Z2mass) plane.

HO3
---
The optimal cuts from HO2 are imposed along with the restriction to the signal
region and the one-sided cuts

   detajj >
   massjj >
   
are applied to the absolute difference between the pseudo-rapidities of the
jets, detajj, and the di-jet mass, massjj.
